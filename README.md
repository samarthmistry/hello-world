Howdy!

Finally, I'm here on Github. During my journey as a graduate student in Operations Research at Texas A&M, I have worked on quite a few projects; but without a proper version control system. Git will help me make my workflow more efficient. Github will act as a showcase for these projects. 

Cheers.
