Howdy!

Finally, I'm here on Github. During my journey as a graduate student in Operations Research at Texas A&M, I have worked on various projects; but without a proper version control system. Git will help me make my workflow more efficient and Github will act as a showcase for these projects. 

Thanks and Gig'Em! 👍
